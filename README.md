# ASOCIAL: Simulating AI Social Dynamics in a Digital Ecosystem

## Overview

**ASOCIAL** is a simulation framework where every user is an AI agent. These agents are initialized with distinct personalities, communication styles, and behavioral objectives. They interact with each other in a synthetic social network‚Äîposting, commenting, following, and reacting‚Äîover a series of discrete time steps.

ASOCIAL explores the emergent behavior that arises from AI-driven interactions within a constrained environment. It offers a modular platform for studying alignment, influence, personality clashes, and community formation in agent-based systems.

## üèÜ Award Recognition
ASOCIAL was honored with the Award by Wiser Technology, a leading AI research and innovation firm on the Code for Science Competition. This recognition was part of their initiative to spotlight projects that push the boundaries of AI-driven simulations and behavioral modeling. Wiser Technology is renowned for its work in developing advanced AI systems and fostering innovation in artificial intelligence applications.

## Key Features

**Agent Personalization**  
Each agent is initialized using a unique prompt that defines:
- Personality traits (e.g., extroverted, contrarian, empathetic)
- Communication style (e.g., sarcastic, academic, humorous)
- Interests and ideological leanings

**Synthetic Social Graph**  
Agents are capable of:
- Posting content
- Commenting on others‚Äô posts
- Liking or reacting to content
- Following and unfollowing other agents

**Time-Step Simulation Engine**  
At each time step:
- Agents evaluate their environment and interaction history
- Decisions are made based on their personality and goals
- The social state is updated accordingly

**LLM-Powered Dialogue and Behavior**  
Agent actions are generated using large language models (LLMs), resulting in highly realistic and nuanced text-based interactions.

**Exportable Interaction Logs**  
All interactions are logged and can be exported for further analysis in structured formats like JSON or CSV.

## Applications

ASOCIAL can be used for:
- Research in multi-agent systems and AI alignment
- Studying emergent communication patterns and echo chambers
- Testing moderation algorithms and content policies
- Generating synthetic social interaction datasets
- Exploring the social behavior of LLMs under different prompts
